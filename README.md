COVID-19's effect on the entire world is apparent as we are struggling to fight this deadly virus. The first COVID-19 case was reportedon December 31, 2019 in Wuhan, China. On January 21, 2020, the CDC (Center for Disease Control) confirmed the first COVID-19case in the U.S. ("A Timeline of Covid-19 Developments in 2020").
Since then, cases have risen exponentially and numerous precautionary measures have been taken to prevent the spread of the virus.By May 26, 2021, there were 168 million cases around the world with 3.49 million deaths. AI, machine learning, and data scienceallows us to analyze the spread of COVID-19 to better understand the virus. It also allows us to help inform the world of newdiscoveries around COVID-19.
Predictions for confirmed cases, recovered, deaths, and were made based on the dataset. To make these predictions, I used Prophet.Prophet is a forecasting tool from Facebook that uses data to predict future behavoir. Prophet gives a future trend to the data insteadof just predictions. It makes forecasts based on irregular holidays and year, weekly, and daily seasonality.
